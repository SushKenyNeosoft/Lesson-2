Data Binding
------------
- Dynamism
- Sometimes we might want to pass the data from typescript file to template and vice versa.
	* In the above scenario we can use data binding
	* Types of Data Binding
		- One Way Data Binding
			* String Interpolation: <h1>{{ <<variable_name>> }}</h1>
			* Property Binding: <p [property]="data"></p>
		- Event Binding
			* It's used for action listeners for templates
		- Two Way Data Binding
			* ngModel Directive
			* It can listen to the variable and change it's value and it can also change the value of variable on change
			* Example: <input type="text" [(ngModel)]="<<variable_name>>">
